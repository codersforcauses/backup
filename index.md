# AGM 2017
Our AGM will be held in the Learning Suite in Reid Library on the 11th of April, from 5-7pm.

We highly encourage anyone to come along regardless of their coding background, as there are plenty of ways to get involved with our club. We'll also be taking sign ups at the event, so if you are new, this is the perfect opportunity to find out what we're all about.

The AGM is primarily a chance for anyone interested in a committee position to nominate themselves; any nominees will be expected to provide a short speech introducing themselves, and describing what they can bring to the role. We encourage anyone who has an interest to get involved, as our club is still young and always in need of fresh perspectives and ideas.

The committee roles that we'll be taking elections for are:

## Club President
The head of the club, who will play a large role in the overarching direction taken by the club, and will oversee the long-term operation of the club. The president will also deal with delegation of tasks and assignments to other committee members, and will involve leadersip of the club's committe, and by extension the club itself. This is an important role that will play a large part in the success of the club. We'd encourage anyone who is interested in running for president to come with some ideas about their long-term goals for the club, and how they'd set about achieving them. 

## Vice President
This role will primarily involve assisting the president with day-to-day tasks, providing a common interface between committee and the president, and overseeing more short-term objectives. The role will also involve some leadership of committee, and will require strong organizational and communicational skills, and an unyielding passion for the club.

## Treasurer
This role will be responsible for all management of the club's finances, and will also play a large role in long-term decision making.

## Secretary
This role will involve all administrative and logistical tasks, and will play a vital part in ensuring the club and its various events are always on track, and that everything is consistently and continously organized. The secretary will also have responsibility over formalizing a consistent and effective structure for the club's various processes, which is an especially important task for this coming term.

## Client Officer
The client officer is a key role in the club, and will be responsible for managing and overseeing all client-related activities, including:
- Finding clients and client projects
- Gathering requirements for potential projects, and screening them appropriately
- Managing all club-client interactions, acting as an interface/bridge between clients and committee
- Handling any client queries, and representing the club to all current and future clients

The role will require strong interpersonal and communicational skills.

## Publicity Officer
This role will be responsible for all publicity and marketing, and will play a vital role in maintaining and promoting awareness of the club and its various activities. The role will have ownership over the following responsibilities:
- Promotion of any club events
- Communication of any upadtes, occasions or happenings within the club
- Any large-scale/widespread communication with the club's member base
- Management and day-to-day running of the club's social media presence
- Maintaining communication with the club's member base, and representing their interests/concerns to committee
- Ensuring constant awareness of the club's presence on campus

## Fresher Representative
This is a vital role that will involve liasoning between freshers and committee, to ensure that:
- Freshers can get as much value as possible out of the club
- Committee understand any concerns or difficulties freshers have engaging with the club
- There is a keen understanding of the mutual value that freshers and club can provide each other

The CS/DS/SE freshers in particular hold a wealth of value and potential for the club, and represent its future. It is important that they are welcomed properly into the club's atmosphere, and this role will be responsible for harnessing and the unearthing the potential and value that freshers can have.

The ideal candidate will be friendly, outgoing and passionate.

We would love to see any first year students with an interest in the club to apply for this role!

## Sponsorship Officer
This role will involve reaching out to organizations and companies to discuss the potential for club sponsorship. As a young club, relationships with larger companies - who expend great efforts to maintain strong presences within university culture - are an invaluable asset that will prove essential to the longevity and success of the club. There are all forms of sponsorship, and funds are only one of them. Access to API's, services, marketing resources, events and opportunities for club members are all ways for companies and sponsorship to play a large role in the club's direction and success.

The sponsorship officer will be responsible for unearthing and pursuing such opportunities, managing any external (non-client) relations the club has, and applying for various grants. 

## Ordinary Committee Member x 2
These roles will involve anything and everything. They are arms and legs to the club's committee, and will handle both general and specialized tasks, as per the club's day-to-day demands. The roles will be responsible for various tasks, and will often assist other committee members in fulfilling their responsiblities. They will play a large part in bringing new ideas to the table, voting on key decisions, and performing various organizational activities that play a large part in keeping the club alive and engaged. The role is adaptible and flexible, and will often switch between longer-term direction and shorter-term activities/objectives.
