# [National Youth Week Hackathon 2017](https://uwa.careerhub.com.au/workgroups/guild-volunteer-hub/Events/309784)

Coders for Causes are teaming up with UWA Guild Volunteering and Anglicare WA to host a weekend hackathon focussing on topics to do with youth and social issues, and everyone is welcome! The projects are not required to be tech based, so anyone and any skillset is invited and welcome to come down!

The Hackathon will run the weekend following Week 5, from the 31st of March to the 2nd of April. You'll get the opportunity to come up with ideas to address the chosen topics, and then a weekend to put your skills to practice and build a product. The end result of your idea might be an app, a marketing campaign, software, a website, or anything!

The event will kick off with a launch event on Friday night where the details of the topics will be presented, you'll be able to socialise over drinks and nibbles, and our friends at FABSOC will be hosting a fashion show to highlight Op Shop couture!

You'll get to meet people from your discipline and out of it, and broaden your knowledge and experience. At the end of the weekend you'll have put your learnt skills into practice. As if that wasn't enough, it's also a great opportunity to volunteer, and we'll even try and throw in some pizza or a muesli bar.

The event is open to you no matter your time commitments over the weekend, you are able to drop in and out of the Hackathon as you need, and can still participate and contribute as much as you can.

Spaces are limited, so please register at CareerHub to ensure you reserve your spot!
